maybe this is complete for running the gpu with mediapipe

There are some arguments that we need to add in new version of python and mediapipe, i think :
1. In hand tracking (static image, max number of hands, model complexity, min detection confidence, min tracking confidence)
2. In pose estimation (static image , model_complexity, upper_body_only, smooth_landmarks, detection confidence, tracking confidence)
3. In face mesh (static image, max. no. of faces, redefine landmarks, min. detection confidence, min. tracking confidence)
4.  To draw the landmarks in face mesh : mpDraw.draw_landmarks(img, faceLms, mpFaceMesh.FACEMESH_CONTOURS, drawSpec, drawSpec)

make sure to pass those to self.pose

Machine Learning A  to Z from Udemy. very very complete course to get started into machine learning

from 27:25 to 36:31 do not forget to include the self.complexity for the complexity attribute in the updated mediapipe hands fil

For those having trouble with the first step setting the camera, downgrade the package protobuf to 3.20.0. It installs with mediapipe but in the version 4.21.1 and the code does not work with that version. So manually downgrade this package and you will be OK.

quick hint if your video is too big for the screen:

cv2.namedWindow("Resized_Window", cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)
cv2.resizeWindow("Resized_Window", 1200, 700)

cv2.imshow("Resized_Window", img)

### resized window values are the rectangle sides, you can adjust them as you wish

at 2:25:03 instead of using FACE_CONNECTIONS use  mp.solutions.face_mesh_connections.FACEMESH_TESSELATION . The library has been updated and FACE_CONNECTIONS will no longer work.

Hello, Can anyone help me install autopy ? I have been getting the same error which he got at 6:04:34. I tried reinstalling it but  nothing happened?

I was trying it with python 3.9.5 kept showing errors while installing. Try to install it in python version 2.7 or 3.8. it worked for me.

Great course the first modules and the finger counting to are the ones who have the most meat.
I managed to pull out a script that recognizes an open and closed hand and depending of the hand state sends a socket to an esp which controls a relay


For everyone trying to replicate this course mediapipe doesn't work on python versions below 3.8, while autopy has been stopped maintaining and doesn't work on python version greater than 3.8. After all this I somehow was able to download mediapipe with the old build files, but opencv stop working due to os package from python 3.8, basically it requires os that comes with python > 3.8. So stop wasting your time trying to setup. Just watch the course and get the concepts. If anyone was able to find solution let me know

For the error in the Pose Module section: def __init__(self, mode=False, complexity = 1, smooth=True, seg= False, smooth_seg= False, detectionCon= 0.5, trackCon=0.5):

        self.mode = mode
        self.complexity = complexity
        self.smooth = smooth
        self.seg=seg
        self.smooth_seg=smooth_seg
        self.detectionCon = detectionCon 
        self.trackCon = trackCon
        self.mpPose = mp.solutions.pose
        self.pose = self.mpPose.Pose(self.mode, self.complexity, self.smooth, self.seg, self.smooth_seg, self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)
        self.mpDraw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils  Use this code and it should work
