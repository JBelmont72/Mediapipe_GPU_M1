There are some arguments that we need to add in new version of python and mediapipe, i think :
1. In hand tracking (static image, max number of hands, model complexity, min detection confidence, min tracking confidence)
2. In pose estimation (static image , model_complexity, upper_body_only, smooth_landmarks, detection confidence, tracking confidence)
3. In face mesh (static image, max. no. of faces, redefine landmarks, min. detection confidence, min. tracking confidence)
4.  To draw the landmarks in face mesh : mpDraw.draw_landmarks(img, faceLms, mpFaceMesh.FACEMESH_CONTOURS, drawSpec, drawSpec)

def __init__(self,static_image_mode=False, model_complexity=1, smooth_landmarks=True, enable_segmentation=False,
                smooth_segmentation=True, min_detection_confidence=0.5, min_tracking_confidence=0.5):
make sure to pass those to self.pose
